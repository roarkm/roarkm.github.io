My name is Michael Roark.
I'm a full stack software engineer based in SF.
My industry background is in enterprise software,
but I just finished a machine learning focused masters in mathematics.
My thesis was about optimization based formal verification of neural networks.
I'm currently interested geometric deep learning and neurosymbolic AI.
